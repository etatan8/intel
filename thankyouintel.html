    <strong>Subject:</strong> A Heartfelt Farewell After an Incredible Journey at Intel</p>

    <p>All,</p>

    <p>As I sit down to write this message, it feels surreal to think that my time with Intel is coming to a close. Opting for the Enhanced Retirement Plan (ERP) was not an easy decision to make. Intel has been more than just a workplace to me ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a second family, a place where I have spent more than half of my lifetime growing both professionally and personally. Walking away from such a meaningful chapter has been challenging, but I feel the time is right for this new phase of my life.</p>

    <p>It all started with a notice on the international students' board when I was still in university. The notice called for final-year Malaysian students in Electrical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, or Computer Engineering to attend a walk-in interview at the Adelaide Hilton. A few friends and I decided to give it a shot, and I still remember the nervous excitement walking into that room. By the end, I was the only one offered a job on the spot, while others were asked to return for a second interview. Little did I know that this moment would be the start of a career that would span decades.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Intel has given me opportunities I could only have dreamed of. A recent highlight is receiving the IAA, an acknowledgment that still fills me with pride. I am thankful for my promotion to PE, a milestone that was the culmination of years of hard work and the guidance of incredible mentors and managers. To all my mentors and managers, I want to offer a special thank you ‚Äî you helped shape my career, and your belief in me made all the difference.</p>

    <p>To my colleagues, working alongside you has been one of the greatest joys of my life. The challenges we tackled, the long and odd hours, the innovations we brought to life ‚Äî I will always carry those memories with me. And beyond the work itself, the friendships we have built are what made every moment special. Intel is a company that strives for greatness, but it‚Äôs the people who make it truly exceptional.</p>

    <p>As I step into the next phase of my life, I do so with immense gratitude. While I am excited for what is ahead, I know I will miss the daily collaboration, problem solving, and the bond we share. I hope to stay connected and look forward to hearing about all the groundbreaking work you will continue to do. I am certain Intel will rise to prominence again, and I am proud to have been part of its journey.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being part of mine.</p>

    <p>Warmest regards,<br>
